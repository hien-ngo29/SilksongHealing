# SilksongHealing
A Hollow Knight mod that adds a charm called **Soulburst**, which allows players to instantly heal 3 masks when they have 99 soul, similar to Silksong. However, while wearing this charm, you will gain only 60% SOUL from striking enemies and can't focus to heal. The only way to heal is to reach 99 soul.
